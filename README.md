## Project Summary
When we open platforms like YouTube, Amazon Prime, or Netflix, we often find ourselves easily discovering interesting movies and TV shows without much effort. For example, after finishing Stranger Things, we might shift to Dark or Moon Water without even searching for them. Similarly, if we watch some Yoga videos on YouTube, our homepage will be flooded with related Yoga videos, which we might start watching without any second thoughts. This magic is made possible by the mathematical algorithms used in Recommender Engines.

In this project, we aim to leverage this technology to build a Movies Recommendation System for Netflix. This system will help content-based companies and service providers to cluster customers and provide user-specific recommendations. By doing so, companies can increase the coverage of their businesses and ultimately lead to more profits.

## Problem Statement
Our project aims to address the challenge faced by content-based companies in providing personalized recommendations that align with their users' interests. With the increasing amount of content available, it is becoming more challenging to filter through and provide relevant recommendations. However, with the wealth of data available, generated by users' viewing histories and feedback, we believe that we can build a better recommendation system.

Our project, therefore, focuses on reshaping the existing recommendation system to incorporate machine learning algorithms and generate content-based recommendations. Specifically, we plan to analyze the data generated by users to cluster movies and TV shows based on similarities in genre, plot, and other factors. We will then use this data to generate daily recommendations for users based on their viewing history and preferences.

By building a better recommendation system, we aim to improve user engagement, drive customer satisfaction, and ultimately increase revenue by providing a better user experience. We will measure the success of our project by tracking the engagement and satisfaction levels of our users, as well as analyzing the revenue generated from increased user engagement.

## Conslusion
Finally , after getting the movies clustered by utilizing the director , genre and general information about the content provided by the Netflix, we have built our recommendation engine.

We had faced a little problem for finfing the value of K in Elbow method and Silhouette method. So we genralise the model and implemented it using five clusters. But, the clusters of k means are more shapr and clear. Their boudries are clearly observed.

Contrary, while implementing the agglomrative clustering, number of clusters have been very easily found out with the help of dendrogram.But the boundries of clusters are not as sharp as k-means. They are interlinked and shows the sign of overfitting.

Atlast we use cosine similarity to find out the most closest content vectors.Then we have extracted top 10 vectors and pull out their title.
